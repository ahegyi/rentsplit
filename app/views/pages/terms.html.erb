<li>We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</li>
<li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that Rentsplit is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user.

</ol>
<h2 id="rights">Rights</h2>
<ol>
<li>Rentsplit does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to Rentsplit a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, available here <%= link_to pages_privacy_url, pages_privacy_url %>.</li>
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.</li>

<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by Rentsplit ("Rentsplit Content"). Rentsplit Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and Rentsplit, Rentsplit owns and retains all rights in the Rentsplit Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Rentsplit Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Rentsplit Content.</li>

<li>Although it is Rentsplit's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment.  Also, Rentsplit reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Rentsplit, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Rentsplit encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Rentsplit is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Rentsplit will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content.  You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.</li>

<li>You agree that Rentsplit is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the Service.  Rentsplit does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.</li>

<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, as between you and Rentsplit, any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content.  You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Rentsplit is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Rentsplit in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Rentsplit, and Rentsplit will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.</li>

<li>It is Rentsplit's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Rentsplit does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted.  If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Rentsplit is free to use any such content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</li>

<p>YOU AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT YOU INCUR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES OR INJURIES THAT ARISE OUT OF Rentsplit'S ACTS OR OMISSIONS, THE DAMAGES, IF ANY, CAUSED TO YOU ARE NOT IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION PREVENTING ANY EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEB SITE, SERVICE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE Rentsplit PARTIES, AND YOU WILL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO ENJOIN OR RESTRAIN THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, ADVERTISING, EXHIBITION OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEB SITE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE Rentsplit PARTIES.</p>
<p>BY ACCESSING THE SERVICE, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE WAIVING RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT ARE AT THIS TIME UNKNOWN OR UNSUSPECTED, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH WAIVER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE, THE BENEFITS OF SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF CALIFORNIA, AND ANY SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY, WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."</p>
<p>Rentsplit IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<h2 id="indemnification">Indemnification</h2>
<p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at Rentsplit's request), indemnify and hold the Rentsplit Parties harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by you.  You will cooperate as fully required by Rentsplit in the defense of any claim. Rentsplit reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of Rentsplit.</p>
<h2 id="arbitration">Arbitration</h2>
<p>You agree that all disputes between you and Rentsplit (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Rentsplit, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Rentsplit hereby expressly waive trial by jury.  As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules.  You may bring claims only on your own behalf.  Neither you nor Rentsplit will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement.  You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Rentsplit is a party to the proceeding.  This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Rentsplit or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.  This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Rentsplit.</p>
<h2 id="time-limitation-on-claims">Time Limitation on Claims</h2>
<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Rentsplit must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<h2 id="governing-law-venue">Governing Law &amp; Venue</h2>
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with Rentsplit exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Rentsplit's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Rentsplit reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.  This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Rentsplit.</p>
<h2 id="entire-agreement">Entire Agreement</h2>
<p>If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity.  These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Rentsplit and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Rentsplit. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Rentsplit. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Rentsplit will be null and void. Rentsplit may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
<h2 id="territorial-restrictions">Territorial Restrictions</h2>
<p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Rentsplit to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature that Rentsplit provides.</p>
<p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.</p>
